# BoostPHP2
A fast, simple, require-and-go out-of-box PHP framework built for PHP4, PHP5, PHP7  
**PHP4 support is in theory, the major versions of PHP supported by us is from PHP 5.2.7 to PHP7.2.8**  
**If you are using PHP7, please don't use PHP7.0, BoostPHP2 will automatically fall back to PHP5 version files for that version because it does not support void return type prompt.**

---

## How to use it
Put the files in BoostPHP directory and simply add following code to your PHP file.

```php
require_once __DIR__ . "/BoostPHP/autoload.php";
```
